## Methodology (from investigating to mapping)

### Step 1 - Test walks and Photographing
We studied the literature and made a list of all the factors that are most commonly found to impact walking experience. A systematic walking audit was conducted across the study path to observe and document physical conditions affecting pedestrian experience. The team recorded field notes and photographs using GPS-enabled mobile devices to take coordination of objects, focusing on predefined indicators such as dangerous intersections, sidewalk encroachments, among others.

### Step 2 - we clustered factors/issues into 3 categories: safety, convenience adn conviviality

### Step 3 - Mapping 
Drawing from both field survey observations and georeferenced data obtained through interviews, the 22 issues were digitized as point features and categorized into thematic groups within a structured GIS database. (Using QGIS)

### Step 4 - 	Visualize all layers in 3D using QGIS2ThreeJS, Export to HTML.
